# spotifyAPI
What it is: integrated web API; follows Spotify's "Implicit Grant" Authorization Flow

Skills exercised: API communication

What I learned: Familiarity with Python, as well as, a solid understanding of the work flow(s) required to obtain authorization to an API.

Challenging Bugs: Encryption of credentials needed to be decoded from bit to string form.

Changes I'd like to Implement: 
+ automatic renewal of token upon expiration
+ search system for endpoints

**clientSecret variable which holds the secret identification for the application has been replaced with 'None'. No data will be retrieved from the server without this secret indentification.**
